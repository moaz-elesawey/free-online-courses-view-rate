# Free Online Courses View Rate
In this relatively small project, I tried the answer the questions of whether students really like Free Online Courses or not and whether they proceed to complete them or not.

using PyTube alongside Python, I created a script to parse YouTube Channels and get some information about videos like IDs, Titles, Number of Views, Rating, etc...

At the first look at the data, It seems that most students don't proceed to complete the full course as the number of Views decreases after the third or the second video in the playlist.

I reach this result by looking at the data of about 50 courses of MIT courses on YouTube.

Looking further to test for more courses from different universities like Caltech, Stanford, Yale, etc...
